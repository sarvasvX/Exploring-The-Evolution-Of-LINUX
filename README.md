# Exploring-The-Evolution-Of-LINUX

## This is a short data exploration project to get information about the contributions to the LINUX github repository over the years, since Linus Torvalds pushed the first commit.

## We'll find out the number of authors contributing to the project, the number of commits so far, the author making the most commits, commits made per year, and finally visualize the year in which most commits were made.

#### P.S. This project is available on DataCamp
